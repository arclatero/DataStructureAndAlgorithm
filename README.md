# DataStructureAndAlgorithm

Assignment 01 DSA

This program creates graphs for mathematical expressions using numbers extracted from a text file. It uses Matplotlib to make the graphs. Instead of using extra tools, it calculates the math directly in the code.

Each math expression is put in a separate part of the code, making it easier to understand. These parts are then put in a dictionary, where each one is given a number. The dictionary keeps track of the expression, color, and label needed for graphing.

The main part of the program calculates the y-values for each expression, makes the graphs, and saves the results to a file. Users choose which expressions they want to see. If they pick specific ones, the program graphs them and saves the results. If they choose to see all expressions, the program graphs them all at once using different colors.

In summary, this program makes it easy to see math expressions visually. By breaking down the math into parts and using Matplotlib, it's simple to understand and use. Users can pick which expressions to see or see them all together, and the results are saved for further study and basis.
